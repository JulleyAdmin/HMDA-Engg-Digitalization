## Next Steps
1. Deploy updated form to staging
2. Get HMDA team to review and test
3. Collect feedback on the changes
4. Make any final adjustments
5. Update other stage forms based on similar feedback patterns

## Impact on Other Stages
These changes to Stage 1 may require updates to:
- Stage 2: DPR form should reference Work ID instead of Project Code
- Stage 3-9: All subsequent stages should use Work ID as reference
- Data migration: Existing projects need Work ID assignment

## Recommendation
Consider creating a master data template that defines:
- Standard product categories across all forms
- Constituency mappings
- Component types library
- Approval authority rules

This will ensure consistency across all 9 stage forms.
