# Stage 9 Form Reconciliation Plan - HMDA Feedback

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the changes needed for Stage 9 (Defect Liability Period & O&M) form based on HMDA feedback. The focus is on removing most monitoring and tracking sections.

## Feedback Analysis & Implementation Plan

### Sections to Remove

#### Remove these sections completely:
1. **Asset Performance Monitoring** section
2. **Defect Management & Tracking** section
3. **All sections below these** including:
   - Maintenance Activities
   - DLP Inspections
   - O&M Training
   - Handover to O&M Team
   - Any other sections

### What Remains

Based on the feedback, Stage 9 should only retain:
- Basic DLP information
- DLP period dates
- DLP bank guarantee details (if present before removed sections)
- Basic project information

## Implementation Steps

1. Open stage9-dlp-om.html
2. Hide all specified sections using `style="display:none"`
3. Keep only essential DLP period information
4. Ensure form still functions for basic DLP tracking
5. Test that feedback system still works

## Impact

This represents a major simplification of the DLP/O&M phase, removing complex monitoring and tracking features. The form will focus only on tracking the DLP period itself rather than detailed defect management.

## Next Steps
1. Implement changes in stage9-dlp-om.html
2. Test remaining functionality
3. Update any references in other stages
4. Create summary document after implementation
