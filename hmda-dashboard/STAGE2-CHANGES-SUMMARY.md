### Form Structure
- Maintained form flow and validation
- Preserved feedback system functionality
- Updated field IDs for consistency

## Data Flow from Stage 1
The form should reference:
- Work ID (from Stage 1)
- File Number (from Stage 1)
- Project details for context

## Testing Checklist
- [x] DPR strategy dropdown shows only 2 options
- [x] Consultant details appear only for external selection
- [x] Agreement section appears only for external selection
- [x] Required fields update dynamically
- [x] Removed sections are hidden
- [x] Administrative sanction fields functional
- [x] Form submission logic updated
- [x] Feedback system still works

## Impact on Other Stages

### Stage 3 (Tendering)
Should reference:
- Administrative sanction amount
- Administrative sanction authority
- Agreement details if external consultant used

### Stage 4-9
All subsequent stages should use administrative sanction details instead of technical sanction.

## Key Improvements
1. **Simplified Process**: Reduced complexity by removing unnecessary technical details
2. **Better Consultant Management**: Clear fields for external consultant tracking
3. **Administrative Focus**: Shifted from technical to administrative approval process
4. **Cleaner Interface**: Removed 5 major sections that were not needed

## Notes for Implementation Team
1. Ensure Work ID and File Number are carried from Stage 1
2. Administrative sanction authority (MC/Govt) will determine approval workflow
3. Agreement upload functionality needs backend storage implementation
4. Consider adding validation for agreement date (should be after DPR start date)

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to staging environment
2. HMDA team review and testing
3. Implement similar simplifications in other stages
4. Update user training materials
5. Create data migration scripts for existing projects
