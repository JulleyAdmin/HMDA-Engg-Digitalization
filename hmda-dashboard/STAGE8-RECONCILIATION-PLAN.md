# Stage 8 Form Reconciliation Plan - HMDA Feedback

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the changes needed for Stage 8 (Project Closure) form based on HMDA feedback. The focus is on significantly simplifying the form by removing most sections.

## Feedback Analysis & Implementation Plan

### Sections to Remove

#### Remove these sections completely:
1. **Completion Certificates** section
2. **Documents Handover** section  
3. **As-built Documentation** section
4. **Financial Closure** section
5. **All sections below Financial Closure**
   - Lessons Learned
   - Performance Evaluation
   - Any other sections after Financial Closure

### What Remains

Based on the feedback, Stage 8 should only retain:
- Basic project information
- Project completion status
- Final inspection details (if present before Financial Closure)
- Any administrative closure items (if present before Financial Closure)

## Implementation Steps

1. Open stage8-project-closure.html
2. Hide all specified sections using `style="display:none"`
3. Keep only essential completion information
4. Ensure form still functions for basic closure tracking
5. Test that feedback system still works

## Impact

This represents a ~80% reduction in form complexity, focusing only on the most essential closure elements. The simplified form will be much easier for users to complete and will reduce administrative burden significantly.

## Next Steps
1. Implement changes in stage8-project-closure.html
2. Test remaining functionality
3. Update any references in other stages
4. Create summary document after implementation
