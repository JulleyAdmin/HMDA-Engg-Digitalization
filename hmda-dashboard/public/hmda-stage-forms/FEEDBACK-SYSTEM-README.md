## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: View the Demo
1. Open `feedback-demo.html` to understand the system capabilities
2. Review all features and benefits explained in the demo

### Step 2: Test the System
1. Navigate to `stage3-tendering.html` (already integrated with feedback system)
2. Look for the floating feedback button on the right side
3. Click to open the feedback panel and test all features

### Step 3: Integration Process
The feedback system is already integrated into Stage 3. To add it to other forms:

#### Manual Integration
Add to the `<head>` section of each HTML file:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="shared/feedback-system.css">
```

Add before the closing `</body>` tag:
```html
<script src="shared/feedback-system.js"></script>
```

#### Automated Integration
Run the integration script (if you have Node.js):
```bash
cd hmda-stage-forms
node integrate-feedback.js
```

## üìã How to Use During Walkthrough

### Pre-meeting Setup
1. Open the stage form you want to demonstrate
2. Ensure the feedback widget is visible (floating button on right side)

- This gives a quick initial impression

#### Step 3: Section-by-Section Review
For each form section:
1. Select the section from the dropdown
2. Rate the section (1-5 stars)
3. Check applicable positive aspects
4. Add detailed comments and suggestions
5. Set priority level (High/Medium/Low)
6. Save the section feedback

#### Step 4: Final Documentation
1. Add overall comments and recommendations
2. Set final approval status
3. Export the feedback report
4. Save for future reference

### Post-meeting Actions
1. Download the generated feedback report
2. Share with development team for implementation
3. Use for follow-up meetings and progress tracking
