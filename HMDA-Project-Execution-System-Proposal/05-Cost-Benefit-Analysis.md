- Annual benefit growth: 5% (inflation adjustment)

| Year | Costs | Benefits | Net Cash Flow | Discount Factor | Present Value |
|------|-------|----------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 0 | Rs 15 Cr | Rs 0 | -Rs 15 Cr | 1.000 | -Rs 15 Cr |
| 1 | Rs 6.5 Cr | Rs 84 Cr | Rs 77.5 Cr | 0.926 | Rs 71.8 Cr |
| 2 | Rs 5.3 Cr | Rs 147 Cr | Rs 141.7 Cr | 0.857 | Rs 121.4 Cr |
| 3 | Rs 5.3 Cr | Rs 210 Cr | Rs 204.7 Cr | 0.794 | Rs 162.5 Cr |
| 4 | Rs 5.3 Cr | Rs 220.5 Cr | Rs 215.2 Cr | 0.735 | Rs 158.2 Cr |
| 5 | Rs 5.3 Cr | Rs 231.5 Cr | Rs 226.2 Cr | 0.681 | Rs 154.0 Cr |

**NPV = Rs 652.9 Cr**

### 3.2 Return on Investment (ROI)

```
Total Benefits (5 years) = Rs 893 Cr
Total Costs (5 years)    = Rs 37.4 Cr
Net Benefit             = Rs 855.6 Cr

ROI = (Net Benefit / Total Cost) × 100
    = (855.6 / 37.4) × 100
    = 2,287%
```
